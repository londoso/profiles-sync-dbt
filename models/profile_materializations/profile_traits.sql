/* PROFILE TRAITS

Materialization of Segment inputs, pt. 3: Full list of traits (i.e. what's passed in as identify calls) for each profile

Every profile will be represented in this table, even if that profile has not had an identify message.

Table is schema-adaptive - as new traits are added to the "identifies" table, they will also be appended to profile_traits.
Redshift, BigQuery, and Snowflake all maintain a table called INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS that we leverage.


Traits will be sequenced in timestamp order (the most recent is prioritized) - future traits are not omitted.
